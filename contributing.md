# Invoke Labs "Platform" Roles

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the Invoke Labs platform roles, we think that's great!

Here's a few things you should know:

1. We only accept changes via github pull request, so you'll need to fork the repository on github, make the changes in your fork, and then submit the pull request.
2. Try to keep your pull requests small and detailed, for a single role only. We usually won't accept pull requests that make changes to multiple roles unless you need to update a dependant role.
3. The goal of our roles is to provide working services with production-ready configurations, not wrappers around apt-get or yum with default configurations-- in other words, you'll need to do more than just installing packages.
4. Please keep documentation up to date. So that means modifying the main readme.md file to include any new roles that you include, along with a detailed description of the reason for the role, as well as ensuring that every role has its own readme file that is also up to date.

### Platform

The reason that we call these the Platform roles is that we want to provide everyone with something that allows them to build automatically an entire software-as-a-service production platform. Most companies that we work with want to jump right into solving their own particular business problem, they don't want to have to spend time installing and configuring their tools.

## Invoke Labs

Invoke Labs is a company based in Vancouver BC. More details about us are available on our [web site](http://www.invokelabs.com). These roles were developed here for use on the products we incubate.
